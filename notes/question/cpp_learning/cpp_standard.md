### how different versions of C++ standard affect the execution of our program
Generally, a compiler will pick a standard to default to. Typically the default is not the most recent language standard -- many default to C++14, which is missing many of the latest and greatest features.

We can query the C++ standard that our compile are using by using a method similar to the following example:
